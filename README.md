# cgkit2-ported

This is a quick port of Matthias Baas' last release of Python Computer Graphics
Kit v2.0.0 from 2013. I needed this to build on Ubuntu 21.04 and Python 3.9 in
order to temporarily revive an ancient GUI project I built to visualize options
prices on a 3D grid (see http://github.com/blais/greeks).

See http://cgkit.sourceforge.net/ for the original source code of this project.

The original README is at [README.txt](README.txt).

This repository was initialized from the following archive:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/cgkit/files/cgkit/cgkit-2.0.0/cgkit-2.0.0-py3k.tar.gz/download
